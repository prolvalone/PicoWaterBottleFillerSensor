This is a simple hypersonic Water Bottle Refiller.  This software is run on a microcontroller made by Raspberry Pi called the PICO, which runs the code.  The device checks for an interruption in the normal range for the hypersonic waves, and turns on a pump to fill the water bottle.

This project taught me a lot about microcontrollers, how they work, and what they can be used for.
